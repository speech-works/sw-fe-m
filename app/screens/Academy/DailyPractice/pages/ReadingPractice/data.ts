    "Visualize the story. This makes your reading more natural and expressive.",
    "Don’t rush. Focus on reading in short, meaningful phrases rather than one word at a time.",
    "Use punctuation to guide your breath. Commas, periods, and dialogue breaks are natural pause points.",
    "Read aloud twice. The first read helps with familiarity. The second builds fluency.",

  poem: [
    "Follow the rhythm. Let the natural beat of the poem guide your pace.",

    "Gently elongate words that carry emotion or emphasis to improve expressiveness.",
    "Try choral reading. Read along with a recorded version to build confidence and internalize the flow.",
    "Poems allow space to breathe. Take your time — each line is a moment to reset.",

  quote: [
    "Read with intention.Understand the meaning before you speak. Let it guide your tone and delivery",
    "Use a calm, steady pace. Avoid rushing. Even short quotes deserve breathing space.",
    "Practice emphasis. Try reading the same quote multiple times, stressing different words to explore meaning and rhythm.",
    "Record & reflect. Listening back to your quote readings can help track progress and reinforce positive speech patterns.",
